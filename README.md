# *LOANZDAPP* 
This is an application that operates on a decentralized system for validating loans. All grant disbursements and transactions, including loan repayments and updates, are encrypted and transferred through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 
Loan grants are approved through anonymous decentralized voting by a group of authorized validators. Validators are identified by a special NFT that works as a blue tick for them, distinguishing them from loan borrowers. 
Users are free to pay their loans using any currency they prefer, thanks to cross-chain token transfers. 
User authentication is performed by using ZK-EVM zero-knowledge proof validation protocols, providing an additional security layer for their accounts. 
All notifications, such as loan repayment reminders, payment confirmations, and loan approval/rejection notices, are managed through a push-protocol for Flutter Dapp.
