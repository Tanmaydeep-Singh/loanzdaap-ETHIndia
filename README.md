# *LOANZDAPP* 
This is a decentralized application for righteous loan validation.
Deployment of all loan grants and transactions such as loan repayment and updation are encrypted and transferred through nft's.
Loan grants are done through anonymous decentralized voting done by group of authorized validators.
The validators are differentiated from a loan borrower through a special nft which is only minted for them and works as a blue tick for validators.
The user can also pay their loan through any currency (s)he wants to, providing cross-chain tokens transfer.
The users are authenticated by zkevm zero knowledge proof validation protocols thus providing an extra layer of security for their accounts.
All notifications (such as loan repayment reminder, payment successful, loan passed/rejected) are managed through push-protocol for flutter dapp.
